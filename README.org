My =Doom-Emacs= configuration.

[[file:splash/emacs.png]]

** Introduction
This is my Emacs configuration, my Hotel California of Creative Writing.

It features all the bells and whistles that I could ever want from a writing environment, and nothing else.

This configuration, like most (if not all) Emacs configurations, is highly opinionated. Unlike most, I think, it is also highly focused, and does very few things outside of writing prose.

For a very detailed walk-through of what this configuration provides, see
[[https://jacmoe.github.io/hccw/][https://jacmoe.github.io/hccw/]]

/The walk-through is currently a work in progress. This notice will be removed once it gets finished./

** Prerequisites

First, make sure that you have at least Emacs 28.1 installed, and have made sure that Git and the other prerequisites of Doom-Emacs are satisfied:
[[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#prerequisites][Doom-Emacs - Prerequisites]]

On my Fedora system, that was accomplished by installing:
#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf install emacs fd-find ripgrep
#+end_src

———————————

This configuration uses the following external dependencies:
*** C compiler

=org-roam= uses a custom SQLite binary to store its database, and it will compile it when it installs. So there must be a C compiler available to Emacs.

On Linux, there is likely to be a C compiler installed.

*** Aspell
We use =Aspell= for spellchecking:

#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf install aspell aspell-en
#+end_src

*** Mermaid
[[https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/][Mermaid]] is used to generate Gantt charts and other diagrams.

Install =npm= if not already installed:
#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf install npm
#+end_src

Then, install [[https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli][mermaid-cli]]:
#+begin_src bash
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
#+end_src

The command-line client needs =Chromium= (or Chrome), and it needs to be told where it is.

Create a configuration file in your home directory, called =puppeteerConfigFile.json=:
#+begin_src json
{
  "executablePath": "/usr/bin/chromium"
}
#+end_src

*** Hugo
I use [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][Ox-Hugo]] to export and generate an Epub, and to write blog posts, and if you want that, you need to install [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]].

Get the latest version from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/latest - choose the Extended version.

While you can find Hugo in the software repositories for your particular operating system it is often an older version, and many newer Hugo themes requires a very recent Hugo.

*** PDF diff and export
In order to be able to export excellent PDFs using LaTeX, we need to install TeX Live.

Installing the following satisfies the requirements of the Org-mode LaTeX / PDF exporter on my system:
#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf install texlive-collection-bibtexextra texlive-collection-latexextra
#+end_src

*** Fonts
This configuration uses the [[https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/Overpass][Overpass]] font. Mono for code, and the regular font for writing. Install both (~Overpass Mono~ and ~Overpass~) on your system so that Emacs can use them.

For Unicode emojis, install an emoji font like [[http://legionfonts.com/fonts/segoe-ui-emoji][Segoe UI Emoji]]

If you want to use your own fonts, do change the configuration, around line 32 in ~config.el~ or in ~.secret.el~ (recommended).

*** Maim and Gifsicle
For creating gif screencasts, we use Maim and Gifsicle. Install =maim= and =gifsicle= using your package manager of choice.
#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf install maim gifsicle
#+end_src

** Installation
*** Hotel California
Clone the Hotel California repository into =~/.doom.d=, like this:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/jacmoe/hotel-california-of-creative-writing ~/.doom.d
#+end_src

*** Doom-Emacs
Make sure that there isn’t a ~.emacs.d~ directory on your machine. If you are running Emacs, there is, so you need to either delete or rename it.

To install Doom-Emacs, clone it into ~.emacs.d~ , and run the Doom-Emacs installation script:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d

~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC
Don’t try to run Emacs just yet!

What you can do, however, is check the installation by running the Doom-Emacs doctor, like so:

=~./.emacs.d/bin doom doctor=

It should run without errors or warnings, but if it doesn’t, you should be able to fix the issues in most cases based on what the doctor orders.

You need to change some variables around line 20 in =config.el=, the location of personal dictionary, bookmarks and Org folders. Also be sure to change the personal information around line 40, and enter the path to =puppeteerConfigFile.json= that you created earlier.


Probably a good idea to add =~./emacs.d/bin= to your =PATH=, for example by adding it to your exports in =.bashrc=.

Now, fire up Emacs, and you should be looking at the Hotel California of Creative Writing starting screen.

All you need to do now is to press =C-x C-f= and start making yourself comfortable with your new writing environment.

You might want to read the extensive guide here: [[https://jacmoe.github.io/hccw/][https://jacmoe.github.io/hccw/]], or at least have it ready as a reference.

Happy Writing!
